A vast majority of the art files in here were created in either Adobe Illustrator or Adobe Photoshop. Almost everything was created and / or edited using Creative Suite 6, but there are a few files here and there that were made using Creative Suite 5.5. So if you're having trouble opening any of the files, that could be why. As a rule of thumb however, if the file hasn't been edited since December 31st, 2012, then it's a CS5.5 file. Any time after that and it's almost certainly a CS6 file.
